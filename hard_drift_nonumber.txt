We report periodic oscillations in the 15-year long optical light curve of the gravitationally lensed quasar Q  at . The signal is enhanced during a high magnification microlensing event undergone by the fainter lensed image, B, of the quasar, between 2003 and 2010. We measure a period of  days, translating into days in the quasar frame. The quest to investigate the nexus between capital market performance and the macroeconomic dynamics in Nigeria is motivated by two significant factors. One, macroeconomic dynamics is a critical issue in any economy, particularly in developing countries. The economic outcomes of government fiscal and monetary policies through development plans, national budget, reforms, and program of agenda; partly depend on the macroeconomic environment. Roasting of vegetables in an oven resulted in an increase in the content of specific amino acids, including Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Thus, it is important to choose the right cooking methods to prevent the loss of free amino acids. The results of the present study emphasize the changes in the contents of free amino acids during cooking with methods that are typically used on a daily basis. Our study on the dynamics of free amino acids caused by various cooking methods provides ample information for future nutritional studies.
