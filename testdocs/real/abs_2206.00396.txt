In spring 2022, the German federal government agreed on a set of measures that aim at reducing householdsâ€™ financial burden resulting from a recent price increase, especially in energy and mobility.  These measures include among others, a nation-wide public transport ticket for 9 EUR per month and a fuel tax cut that reduces fuel prices by more than 15 %. In transportation research this is an almost unprecedented behavioral experiment. It allows to study not only behavioral responses in mode choice and induced demand but also to assess the effectiveness of transport policy instruments.  We observe this natural experiment with a three-wave survey and an app-based travel diary on a sample of hundreds of participants as well as an analysis of traffic counts. In this first report, we inform about the study design, recruiting and initial participation of study participants.
