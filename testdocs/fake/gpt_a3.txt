In this paper, we study the determinants of the quality of the national health insurance (NHI) services at the scale of the districts in Vietnam. We use a complementary logit model to analyze the effects of the NHI coverage and the NHI access to health professionals on the quality of the NHI services at the scale of the districts in Vietnam. We test for the under- or overestimation of the effects of NHI coverage and NHI access to health professionals on the quality of the NHI services at the scale of the districts in Vietnam. We find that both the NHI coverage and the NHI access to health professionals have significant effects on the quality of the NHI services at the scale of the districts in Vietnam. The results of the study could be used to improve the design and delivery of the NHI in Vietnam.
