In this paper, we investigate the performance of a class of nonlinear multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for the optimization of a single-objective optimization algorithm. The core idea is to use a class of evolutionary algorithms that, for a multi-objective problem, have been shown to have high performance in a single-objective optimization algorithm. In the literature, these algorithms have been called the \u2018multi-objective evolutionary algorithms\u2019 (MOEAs). We use these algorithms in the optimization of a multi-objective criterion function. We show that using the MOEAs, it is possible to achieve a speed up of at least ten-fold. We also show that the performance of the MOEAs is not dependent on the number of objectives, and that the choice of the MOEA is independent of the choice of the objective function. We discuss the relationship between the MOEA and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.
